# Stitch Café Frontend

This folder contains the frontend code for the Stitch Café application.

## How to Deploy

1. **Upload this entire folder** (`stitch_caf_menu_table_12`) to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect the repository to Vercel or Netlify.
3. The `index.html` at the root will automatically redirect visitors to the Main Menu.

## Structure
- `swiggy-style_elite_main_menu_390x2500`: The main menu entry point.
- `merchant_dashboard`: The merchant dashboard.
- `auth_login_page`: Login page.
- Other folders: Sub-pages for menu categories.

## API
By default, the app will try to connect to a local API. If the API is unreachable (e.g., on a live demo without a backend), it will fall back to **Sample Mode**, displaying demo data so you can still view the design and layout.
